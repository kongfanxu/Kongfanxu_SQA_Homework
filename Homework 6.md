##Comparison
###Defination
Testing is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the product or service under test.

QA is a way of preventing mistakes or defects in manufactured products and avoiding problems when delivering solutions or services to customers.

###Why do we test
Two main reasons:
- To make a judgment about quality or acceptability
- To discover problems

###Mission
Testing's primary contribution to quality is to identify problems that we wish we could have prevented in the first place.
The mission of QA is to prevent defects in the first place as well as to remove defects that do creep into the product. That requires processes beyond testing.

Tesing is only part of quality assurance activities.

###Roles
Totally different roles
QA focuses on the quality of the proceess management during the whole development process. 
Testing is based on the technique aspect, test the software itself.

QA mainly emphasizes control and evluation. Testing is part of lifecycle.

###Summary
- Testingâ€™s goal is to find errors in a certain product while quality assurance deals more with the prevention of errors.
- Standards in testing are determined by quality assurance.
