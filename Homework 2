Chapter 4
  In this chapterï¼Œit mainly talks about QA and V&V. In QA section, it tells us how to defct handling and 
resolution. After finding defect, we know how to deal with the defects. Then we have defect measurement 
and analysis. 
  During the lifecyle of a software, just like the waterfall model, we will do QA thruogh the whole process. 
In requirement, design and coding, we mainlu foucus on defect prevention. In other parts, we foucus on defect 
removal and defect containment. 
  V&V in the V-model, testing is operating along with the implementation. At the end of the chapter, it 
compares QA activity and V&V view.
Chapter 5
  This chapter mainly talks about quality engineering and the relationship between QA and SQE.
  QA activities need additional support: planning and goal setting and management. The assessment of quality 
and reliability needs data collection, analysis and modeling and providing feedback for management.
Chapter 6
  The key of this chapter is testing. And by asking "why","how" and "what", it explains the tesing deeper.
  By testing, we can find the defects. So we can guarantee the quality of a software. How do we test? Firstly, 
we need a plan. Then we follow the plan to execute. Finally we do analysis and follow-up. That's the main steps 
of testing.
  Also, there are many ways to do test, such as white-box tesing, black-box tesing, unit tesing and so on.
