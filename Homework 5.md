##Formal methods

Formal methods = formal specification + formal verification
Formal specification:
  Correctness focus
  Different levels of details
  3Cs: complete, clear, consistent
  Two types: descriptive & behavioral
Descriptive formal specifications
  Logic: pre-/post-conditions
  Math functions
  Notations and language support: Z, VDM, etc
Behavioral formal specifications: FSM, Petri-Net, etc

Formal verification:
Formal verification: proof of correctness
  Formal specs: as pre/post-conditions
  Axioms for components or functional units
  Composition (bottom-up, chaining)
  Development and verification together
Other related approaches
  Semi-formal verification
  Model checking
  Inspection for correctness
  
##Model checking

The model checker is a software that runs an algorithm to check the validity of the proposition. If it is checked to be true, a proof is said to be produced. Otherwise, a counterexample is given, much like a failed test case that can be analyzed further for defect fixing.
